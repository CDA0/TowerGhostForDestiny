		<div class="tab-pane fade" id="viewoptions">
			<p>
				You may find these options by visiting the <i>View</i> menu filter and clicking on <i>View Options</i> at the bottom. Once opened the controls for adjusting the view are displayed inline at the top of the app.
			</p>
			
			<ul>

				<li>
					<strong>Container Width</strong> This option allows you to control how wide you would like the overall container to be, the default option ensures proper padding on both sides for large displays, this option will not affect the layout for most mobile displays but will work for most tablet displays.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Vault Mode</strong> The default option ensures that the Vault column is always as wide as all the other columns, setting it to Custom allows you to make the Vault column wider, do note that this option will not affect mobile displays only tablets and desktops.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Vault Width</strong> This option is only available under "Custom" Vault Mode, setting this option will make the Vault column wider than the default 25%.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Number of Columns</strong> This option is only available under "Default" Vault Mode, this option works as a matrix of column modes depending on your display.<br>
					Each row has a designated tag (xs,sm,md,lg) they are ordered from smallest display to largest so mobile displays use xs portrait and sm landscape. Desktop displays most likely use md or lg tag, each tag is dependent upon your resolution so 1 or 2 out of the 4 rows only apply to your device. Example: You have a mobile display that currently shows 1 column portrait (xs) and 2 columns landscape (sm) and you'd like to change it to 1/3, what you do is set the second row (sm) to 3 so it'll display 1 | 3 | 3 | 4 instead of 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 buttons selected.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Vault Columns</strong> This option allows you to choose how many columns of items you want to see for the Vault profile, the default is 4 with the option of fitting more icons per row as the number goes up.

				<li>
					<strong>Vault Position</strong> First/Left - The vault is displayed first on mobile, on the left side for wide displays. Last/Right - The vault is ordered last or on the right side for wide displays.
