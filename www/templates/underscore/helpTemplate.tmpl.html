		<div class="tab-pane fade" id="viewoptions">
			<p>
				You may find these options by visiting the <i>View</i> menu filter and clicking on <i>View Options</i> at the bottom. Once opened the controls for adjusting the view are displayed inline at the top of the app.
			</p>
			
			<ul>

				<li>
					<strong>Container Width</strong> This option allows you to control how wide you would like the overall container to be, the default option ensures proper padding on both sides for large displays, this option will not affect the layout for most mobile displays but will work for most tablet displays.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Vault Mode</strong> The default option ensures that the Vault column is always as wide as all the other columns, setting it to Custom allows you to make the Vault column wider, do note that this option will not affect mobile displays only tablets and desktops.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Vault Width</strong> This option is only available under "Custom" Vault Mode, setting this option will make the Vault column wider than the default 25%.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Number of Columns</strong> This option is only available under "Default" Vault Mode, this option works as a matrix of column modes depending on your display.<br>
					Each row has a designated tag (xs,sm,md,lg) they are ordered from smallest display to largest so mobile displays use xs portrait and sm landscape. Desktop displays most likely use md or lg tag, each tag is dependent upon your resolution so 1 or 2 out of the 4 rows only apply to your device. Example: You have a mobile display that currently shows 1 column portrait (xs) and 2 columns landscape (sm) and you'd like to change it to 1/3, what you do is set the second row (sm) to 3 so it'll display 1 | 3 | 3 | 4 instead of 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 buttons selected.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Vault Columns</strong> This option allows you to choose how many columns of items you want to see for the Vault profile, the default is 4 with the option of fitting more icons per row as the number goes up.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Vault Position</strong> First/Left - The vault is displayed first on mobile, on the left side for wide displays. Last/Right - The vault is ordered last or on the right side for wide displays.

			<p>
				Reference information regarding the tooltip stats and stat rolls.
			</p>

			<ul>

				<li>
					<strong>D</strong> Indicates the value was sourced from DestinyDB.com.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>A</strong> Indicates the value was sourced from Destiny's official Armory database.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Stats Format</strong> {Label} {Current} {MinMax} {Base} [Bar Represent's the base value].
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Current</strong> - The item's current stat as sourced from the API for your item.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>MinMax</strong> - The item's Min/Max value provided by DestinyDB/Armory data.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Base</strong> - The item's base stat as sourced from DestinyDB.com for that item.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Bar Graph</strong> - Reflect the item's base value.
				</li>

				<li><h3>Stat Roll</h3></li>
				

				<li>The stat values (Int/Dis/Str) increase in relation to the item's light level and preset bonus points at certain light level break points.
				</li>

				<li>The first number displayed is the combined stat points, let's suppose your Helmet has 50 Intellect and 50 Discipline the first number will be 100.<br>
					If the item has not been leveled, stat nodes unlocked then the CSP displayed will be normalized to include the bonus after it's been leveled.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Stat Roll Format</strong> {Stat Roll} {Current CSP}(Current CSP after Bonus) {Percentage1}-{Percentage2} ({MaxCSP}/{PerfectRoll})
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Stat Roll</strong> - The total number of points your armor currently has available, if the item does not have a stat node unlocked the value before it is unlocked is shown.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Current CSP after Bonus</strong> - Only displayed for items that do not have a stat node unlocked, the value in parentheses indicates the combined stat points after it is unlocked
				</li>

				<li>The two percentages indicate the stat roll in relation to a 'perfect' max roll.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Percentage1</strong> - indicates what the current stat value is in relation to the a perfect max roll (base stats/perfect roll).
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Percentage2</strong> - indicates what the stat value will be once infused to max light in relation to the max roll (future max stats/perfect roll)*
				</li>

				<li>*Note: The second percentage and first number are prediction calculations based on what the item will look like at max light level, these calculated values have room for error due to the internal formula Bungie uses so it might be off by 1 point or up to 2 points at most.
				</li>

				<li>The next set of numbers in parentheses indicate the max point values available for that armor.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>MaxCSP</strong> - The first number indicates the CSP once the item is infused to max light, this number should not ever change. (1-3% change over a large difference in light level such as 280 to 335)
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>PerfectRoll</strong> - The second number is the most points anyone can have for that type of armor aka the perfect roll.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Color Legend</strong> - The color of the text and background of an armor item indicates the quality of the armor.
				</li>

				<li>If the stat roll color is green then it meets or exceeds the minimum required to reach a T12 build (97%+)
				</li>

				<li>If the stat roll color is yellow then it is upto 4 points below the minimum, enough to reach a T11 build (92-96%+)
				</li>

				<li>If the stat roll color is red then the stat roll is below the required minimum to reach T11 or T12 armor distribution. (0-91%)
				</li>

							<strong>Effective Tier</strong> Effective tier is the current number of skill tiers achieved with your armor
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Theoretical Tier</strong> Theoretical tier is the potential number of skill tiers you can achieve if stat points distributed differently
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Sum CSP</strong> Total number of skill stat points for all the armor you have equipped on that character
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Tier CSP</strong> Total number of points needed to reach the theoretical tier, Tier 10 for example requires 600 points (60 per Tier, 10 Tiers)
						</li>

						</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Light</strong> Equip the armor and weapons with the most Light points from any character or vault.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Skill (Int/Disc/Str)</strong> Optimize armor for Tier 5 for that skill, ensure skill doesn't go too much over 300 points, if so it will automatically reduce the skill to arond 300 and buff the other stats.
