##Known Issues

-    Moving materials/consumables causing splits/merges is still buggy
-    DestinyExotics doesn't recognize certain weapons you might have
-    Mobile app has problems logging in
-    Visit the [Issues](https://github.com/dasilva333/DIM/issues) for more information
  

##Troubleshooting 
Xbox & PSN Support now available, the app should prompt you to log in with Bungie.net using XBL or PSN credentials [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/xzrpKxV.png) if you don't see that message then go to Settings > Log in XBL/PSN and click Done when complete. After clicking Done the items should load automatically give it a few seconds to load, if the page doesn't load after sign in then try Settings > Refresh Items. Good luck guys and remember this is still a beta build.

XAP - Windows Phone users, you need to have developer mode enabled on your phone to be able to side load.

[WP Install Guide] (http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/apps/how-do-i-install-apps-from-an-sd-card)
Deploying this via SD card doesn't work, when you try to tap on the XAP it just says failed to install company app. However, deploying it from a PC using the Application Deployment tool does work properly.
