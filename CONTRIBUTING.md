5. After testing your changes, commit them back to your branch.
6. Submit a new pull request https://github.com/dasilva333/TowerGhostForDestiny/compare/

That's it, if done correctly I should be able to just automatically accept your changes and test them before including them in the next version of TGD.

Note: If you are making any javascript changes to the project there are a few additional steps to ensure that Google Analytics doesn't log any crashes or errors that occur.

TLDR: Remove ga.js from index.html while working on a private branch
