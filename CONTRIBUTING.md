## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

*Please ask first* before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding guidelines used throughout the project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

### Pull Request Step by step instructions:

1. Checkout my project on Github
https://github.com/dasilva333/TowerGhostForDestiny/
2. Click Fork on the top right corner to make a copy of my project for yourself
3. Use Git or SVN to checkout your project your changes to begin 
4. Follow the manual install instructions to get the package running for your system/browser

5. After testing your changes, commit them back to your branch.
6. Submit a new pull request https://github.com/dasilva333/TowerGhostForDestiny/compare/

That's it, if done correctly I should be able to just automatically accept your changes and test them before including them in the next version of TGD.

Note: If you are making any javascript changes to the project there are a few additional steps to ensure that Google Analytics doesn't log any crashes or errors that occur.

TLDR: Remove ga.js from index.html while working on a private branch
